    "#### Original:\n",
    "\"The catalysts were prepared based on a co-impregnation method. A support substrate (1.0 g) was impregnated with 4.5 mL of an aqueous solution of specified metal precursors at 50 °C for 6 h. After vacuum drying at 110 °C, the product was calcined at 1000 °C under air for 3 h to yield a catalyst. When a water-sensitive metal alkoxide was employed, the impregnation was sequentially performed in the order of an aqueous solution of tungstate and an ethanol solution of a metal alkoxide. The obtained catalysts were thoroughly ground before any usage. The catalyst preparation was appropriately parallelized with the aids of a parallel hot stirrer (Reacti-Therm, Thermo Scientific) and a centrifugal evaporator (CVE-3100, Eyela). Twenty catalysts were produced in one batch. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reaction conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Once catalysts are activated at 1000 °C for 160 min under O2, the temperature is stepwise declined from 900 to 850, 800, 775, 750, and 700 °C. At each temperature, the total flow volume (10, 15, and 20 mL/min/channel), the CH4/O2 ratio (2, 3, 4, and 6 mol/mol), and the Ar concentration (PAr = 0.15, 0.40, 0.70 atm) are stepwise varied. One reaction condition is held for 6–7 min, which allows 2–3 rounds of sampling in the same condition for acquiring the error range of observations. The ascending temperature protocol was not employed as it causes excessive CO and CO2 production due to the combustion of carbon deposits. The height of the catalyst bed was fixed at 10 mm, leading to a contact time of 0.75, 0.50, or 0.38 s at the given total flow volumes. Combined variations in the temperature, the total flow volume, the CH4/O2 ratio, and the Ar concentration lead to 216 conditions per catalyst and 4320 observations for 20 catalysts in a single automated operation.\""
